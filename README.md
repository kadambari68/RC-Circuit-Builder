# RC-Circuit-Builder
A virtual lab prototype to build a resistor-capacitor circuit and check its connections which was assigned by the mentors in summer internship (2023) for Virtual Labs at IIT Roorkee.

It is created using HTML CSS JavaScript (JsPlumb toolkit). The components are draggable and can be dropped onto the workspace to make connections using the flowchart workflow.
